You must acknowledge that this node server and it's author is not responsible if critical notifications are not sent.
This node server was created to make it easier for ISY users to send notifications and, but you should not rely
on this for critical messages, and you should also setup monitoring programs on the ISY as instructed in the README.

However, I will attempt to make this node server as reliable as possible.

If you agree, you must set the configuration parameter 'acknowledge' value to 'I understand and agree'
